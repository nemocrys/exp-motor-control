# ACRT
Periodic change of rotation direction with a DC motor

## Description

ACRT (Accelerated crucible rotation) is a technique initially used for the rotation of crucibles during crystal growth [1].

Motor rotation rate is increased and decreased in a periodic way, optionally changing also the direction.
